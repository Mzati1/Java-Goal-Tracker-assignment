# GROUP 4 OOPR ASSIGNMENT

## Goal Tracker
This goal tracker will allow you to create S.M.A.R.T goals and provide motivation aswell as provide you with visual represention of your Progress for these goals.

#### Below is relevant information reguarding out project:
## Folder Structure

When you start a new Java project in Visual Studio Code, you'll typically find the following folder structure:

- `src`: This folder holds your Java source code files.
- `lib`: You can use this folder to manage external dependencies.
- `bin`: Compiled output files are generated in this folder by default.
- `out` : folder serves as the designated location for compiled Java files and resources.

## IDEA and CODE Editor Used
Throughout this project the IDEA was [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and Code Editor was [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Useful Resources

Here are some helpful resources that we used to implement some features:

- **`Singleton Implementation`**: Learn about the Singleton design pattern and best practices by reading this insightful article on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/java-singleton-design-pattern-best-practices-examples). This was used to implement the goal manager and the settings manager
- **`Adding a Listener`**: For implementing event Listers in this java application, this stack Overflow answer provided a helpful example: [How to add a listener](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22175722/18248216).
- **`MouseListener Implementation`**: For implementing a Mouse listerner in this java application, this Stack Overflow answer provided a helpful example: [Adding the MouseListener](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46200556/18248216).
- **`Serialization`**: [Serialization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/serialization-in-java/) is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream, allowing us to save data even when the program closes.
- **`File Handling`**: Resources for file handling were found [HERE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-handling-in-java/). This allowed us to write and read to our "goalManager".ser file to enable serialization.
-- **`Java Iterator`**: How to use a Java iterator and relative infomation about were found [HERE](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_iterator.asp). This was used to implement the clear completed goals feature.


## Libraries and Dependancies

Here are all the Libraries and dependacies used in this project together with their sources

- **`JDatePicker`**: [JDatePicker](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jdatepicker/) JDatePicker is a set of advanced DatePicker controls for Java Swing applications. 

- **`JFreeChart`**: [JFreeChart](https://www.jfree.org/index.html)  free Java chart library. JFreeChart supports pie charts (2D and 3D), bar charts (horizontal and vertical, regular and stacked), line charts, scatter plots, time series charts, high-low-open-close charts, candlestick plots, Gantt charts, combined plots, thermometers, dials and more. We got the .Jar file [HERE](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jfreechart/files/1.%20JFreeChart/1.0.15/).
